I joined the team at Quartz right as they were planning a major site redesign and contributed to the development of Quartz 3.0. The [project](http://qz.com/246831/quartz-has-a-new-look-and-for-the-first-time-a-homepage/
) was a complete overhaul of the original UI with a focus on touchscreen and mobile devices and introduced a homepage for the first time. Quartz is built on Wordpress with Backbone.js on the front-end.
