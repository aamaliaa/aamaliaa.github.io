Jordan was a Florida resident who chose to let the world of Twitter decide which candidate would get his vote in the 2012 presidential election. Participants submitted their votes by hashtagging their tweets with either [#jordanvoteromney](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23jordanvoteromney&src=typd&mode=realtime) or [#jordanvoteobama](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jordanvoteobama&src=typd&mode=realtime). The candidate that received the most votes was chosen on Jordanâ€™s absentee ballot.

I worked on this project with a team of art directors and copywriters and led the development of the voting system as well as the website myself. I set up a continuously running PHP script that utilized the Twitter Streaming API to filter the hashtag "tweet-votes" and update the percentages on the Vote For Jordan site in real-time.
