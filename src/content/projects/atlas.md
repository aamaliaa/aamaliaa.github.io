I led development of [Atlas](http://atlas.qz.com), Quartz's [platform for discovering and sharing charts](http://qz.com/434425/atlas-the-new-home-for-charts-and-data/).

The site is built with React and Node.js and is [isomorphic](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/21/react-to-the-future-with-isomorphic-apps). Quite the buzzword, but it means that the same React javascript components are rendered on the server-side as well as the client-side, which proved to be a huge convenience in terms of development. In the past, I've worked on projects that either forego server-side rendering of content completely (and rely solely on the API) and others that use two separate templates to render the same exact markup (PHP and underscore.js, for example). I introduced the team to Node.js and React + Flux while developing the site.
