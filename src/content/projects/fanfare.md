Fanfare allowed concertgoers to link up with Facebook friends with similar musical tastes and assisted with group ticket purchasing/distributing of funds.

As a huge music fan and concertgoer myself, I came up with the idea after trying and failing to find a friend to go see [Quadron](http://soundcloud.com/quadronmusic) with me at Rockwood Music Hall.

The app was written in PHP and Javascript in less than 24 hours and utilized the Facebook and Songkick APIs for AngelHack NYC 2012. My team took home a prize from Facebook for Fanfare's use of the Facebook Open Graph API.
