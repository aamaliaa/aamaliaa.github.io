I like to make things. I am fascinated with the way things work and have been a tinkerer for as long as I can remember&mdash;[LEGOS](http://www.aamaliaa.com/post/56397901620/legos-were-are-my-favorite) were and still are my favorite toy. That cool place where technology, design, and creativity intersect is where I like to spend most of my time.

I currently work as a **product engineer** at **[Beme](http://www.beme.com)**.
