I like to make things. I am fascinated with the way things work and have been a tinkerer for as long as I can remember. That cool place where technology, design, and creativity intersect is where I like to spend most of my time.

I most recently worked as a **full-stack engineer** at **[Beme](http://www.beme.com)**.
