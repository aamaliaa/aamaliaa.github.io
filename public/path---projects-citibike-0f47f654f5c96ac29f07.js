Bicycle directions between the closest stations to each of the two points that you\'ve specified will be plotted on the map.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Citibike",link:"http://citibike.amaliaviti.com",tags:null,github:"http://github.com/aamaliaa/citibike",image:null,created:"June 2013"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/projects/citibike/"}}}});
